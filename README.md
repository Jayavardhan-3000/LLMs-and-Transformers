# LLMs and Transformers — Notes, Cheat Sheets, and Experiments

This repository is a personal collection of learning resources related to
Large Language Models (LLMs) and Transformer-based architectures.

The goal of this repo is to store clear, concise, and structured material
created while learning and experimenting, starting with a self-made
cheat sheet PDF.
